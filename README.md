Cafe Order Management System that manages the orders at RU Cafe.

## **Description**
This project lets the user order multiple items from RU Cafe. The items available in the menu are coffee, donut, and sandwich. When ordering, the user can also select any combination of options they want from the respective item (Cup Size for coffee, Protein option for sandwich, etc.). The user can also select one or more from a group of addons for each item. The price updates in real time as the user selects different options and addons from the selected item.
